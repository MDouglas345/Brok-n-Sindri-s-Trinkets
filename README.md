# Brok N Sindri's Trinkets
A mod that aims to bring gameplay and mechanics from God of War into Minecraft!

## Planned Features

### Throwing Mechanic 0.3
A system that allows players to throw their weapon / tool and have it stay where it lands. 

#### Worthy Enchantments 
Enchantments that allow players to recall their weapon /tool on demand. Worthy I is the basic recall functionality; Worthy II is a more loyal item that cannot be
picked up by other players.

### Enchantment Galore 1.0

#### Pinned 
An enchantment that will cause a player / mob to be forzen in place / moved with the thrown entity. Will only be unpinned once the player dies, disconnects, or 
the thrower recalls their weapon. Requires Worthy Enchantment.

#### Frost Imbued 
An enchantment that causes ice to spawn in the area surrounding a landed item. Players / mob will experience a slowed / weakness effect.

#### Flame Imbued 
An enchantment that causes fire to spawn in the are surrounding a landed item. Players / mob will be set on fire when hit.

#### Lightning Imbued 
An enchantment that causes a lightning strike where the item lands. Causes a small explosion on impact.


### Visuals 0.6

Each enchantment will cause the item to have some visual effect so they are identifiable by abilities


## If Odin Wills It 1.1+
These are major features that will be eventually added if I have time.


### Additional key'd abilies
Each enchantment will have a corresponding secondary ability that players can trigger.

Some examples :

when secondary key is held while holding a lightning imbued weapon will cause the player to lock onto other mobs / players
and when released will flash attack to each.

Holdin the secondary key on a Flame imbued item will cause a steam of fire to shoot from the player

Holding the secondary key on a Frost imbued item will cause the area to be overcome by a terrible cold.

### NPCS
Obviously a mod named after Brok and Sindri would have them as npcs, right?
